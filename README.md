# Prerequisites
This assignment assumes you have completed the following modules

1.2 Android Versions
1.3 Development Environment
NOTE: Be sure to name this project HW1 and its packages starting with lastname.firstname.hw1.

This assignment is a 'checkmark' assignment; it does not directly count into your grade score, but if you do not submit a working 'hello world' your overall grade will be reduced by a '-' (A becomes A-, A- becomes B+, etc). The intent here is to ensure that everyone's development environment works before HW2 is assigned. Because the assignment is so simple, it shouldn't carry as much positive weight as the other assignments. Because it is so important to do, it should carry a high penalty if not done.

# Requirements
Follow the instructions in the class video to create a 'hello, world' application, export it, and send it to me.

Be sure to use the versions of Java, Eclipse, and the Android SDK/tools stated in class!

Note: DO NOT update your versions of Eclipse or the Android SDK/tools during the semester! I want to be sure that everyone is running the same versions of the tools so the grader will see your submissions the same way that you submitted them.

# Submitting Your Assignment
